# docker-zoneminder

Modern, best-practices Debian-based Zoneminder container

[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

**IMPORTANT:** This is a personal project only. PRs are accepted, but this is not supported and "issues" will likely not be fixed or responded to. This is only for people who understand the details of everything invovled.

This repo attempts to provide a modern, best-practices Docker image for current ZoneMinder versions, using a current Debian version base. The image provides ZoneMinder and Apache but (like a proper Docker image) requires an external MySQL server. The image is vehemently NOT auto-updating, as doing so in a Docker image is a mortal sin. If you want to update, then pull a newer tag.

**NOTE:** If you want to use the event server, then you'll need to mount the appropriate configuration files in to the image at ``/etc/zm/es_rules.json``, ``/etc/zm/zmeventnotification.ini``, and ``/etc/zm/secrets.ini``; examples are included in this repo.

In addition, the output of `mod_status` is exposed at `/server-status`.
